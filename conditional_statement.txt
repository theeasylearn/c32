what is condition statement?
    statement(code) which execute conditionally is called condition statement. means code may or may not execute based upon some condition. to do this we use decision makeing statement.

what is decision makeing statement?
    code in which we check some condition which always return either true or false.

what are the decision makeing statement.
    1 if decision makeing
    2 if else decision makeing
    3 if elseif ladder decision makeing
    4 switch decision makeing
    5 nested if decision makeing

1) if decision makeing
    in this we check some condition using relational expression. if relational expression is true then code written inside {} pair will execute

    syntax 
    if(relational expression)
    {
        code...
    }
    example
    int number;
    printf("enter number");
    scanf("%d",&number);
    if(number==0) // < > <= >= == !=
    {
        printf("it is zero");
    }

 2 if else decision makeing
 in this we check some condition using relational expression. if relational expression is true then code written inside {} pair will execute. if relational expression is false then code written after else & inside {} will execute.
    if(relational expression)
    {
         code...
    }
    else
    {
        code....
    }

    example 
    int number
    printf("\n enter number")
    scanf("%d",&number)
    if(number<0) // < > <= >= == !=
    {
        printf("it is negative number");
    }
    else 
    {
        printf("it is positive number");
    }
